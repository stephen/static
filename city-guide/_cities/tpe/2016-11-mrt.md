The MRT subways are really good. It goes pretty much everywhere (except the Costco...) and headway between trains is short. The stations are clean and (thankfully) air conditioned.

The easycard (悠遊卡) works on busses and trains and even most convenience stores. You can find cute card variations at a lot of 7-11s or at the Taipei Main Station.

For mainlanders, I learned that Taiwanese folks prefer the term 捷運 over 地鐵.
