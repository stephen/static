The museum and food were both a little disappointing. The museum is pretty small, and there isn’t much to see. The food looks aesthetic, but isn’t actually very tasty. We tried almost all the desserts, and I didn’t think any of them were very good besides the soft serve and the hot tea. The cold drinks we got were especially not very good. It’s probably still worth to come once and try it, but don’t have high expectations.
