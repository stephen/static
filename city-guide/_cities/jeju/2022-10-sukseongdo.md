This was probably the best kbbq I’ve had in my life. The black pork was delicious, and the workers are helpful and friendly. We came twice while we were in Jeju. The first time we came at 4:30pm and waited 40 mins. The second time we came an hour before opening and got seated 10 mins after opening. Some of the speciality meats sell out in the afternoon, but we thought the normal meats were just as good if not better than the limited meats.
