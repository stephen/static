The drinks and food are all good, though a little pricey. My go-to is the ochazuke and katsu sando. I'm not a big matcha fan, so my picks are the hojicha and sesame lattes.

On Sundays, they sometimes make Japanese milk bread which is by far my favorite. The baking schedule seems a bit irregular though, so it can be hard to get.
