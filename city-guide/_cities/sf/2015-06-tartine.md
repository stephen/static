Tasty but pricey. For snacks, I like the tres leches cake, bread pudding, and almond croissant. they used to make a great rice pudding.

For lunch, items that are baking-first (sandwiches, tartines, toasts...) are quite good. Other things are okay. The coffee is fine at best.

There's also Tartine Bakery a few blocks down. Maybe surprisingly, the flavors and textures are not quite the same and worth a try.
