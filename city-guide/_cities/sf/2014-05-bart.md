Kind of a dinosaur, but nice to get to parts of Oakland and Berkeley from the city. Service on sundays and nights can be bad - 20 minutes between trains.

BART has been introducing new train cars for a few years now which are much, much better. The old stock is literally 50 years old at this point.
