The best grocery store in the bay area. There are two locations.

The highlights here are the ready-made food (delicious onigiri - try the unagi or shrimp tempura!) and the expansive produce selection. If it's in season, it's here. Spring through fall: go for peaches, cherries, and nectarines. In the winter, the grapes are great.
