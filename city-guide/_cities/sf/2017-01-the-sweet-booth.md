The most delicious Taro Smoothie you've ever had. I like it without boba.

I have gone countless times, but the proprieter (Calvin) does not seem to recognize me which makes me a little sad. Last time I went, it seemed like they were looking to sell the business, so window for experiencing this tier of taro smoothie may be closing.
