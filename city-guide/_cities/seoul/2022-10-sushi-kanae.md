All the pieces were delicious, especially the signature chu-toro. We came for lunch, and the price is a steal for how much sushi you get and how high quality everything is. The chef didn’t speak much English (and we didn’t speak much Korean) but he was very kind and funny.

You need a Korean phone number in order to make a reservation, so our Korean friend made one for us. You could probably also try to ask your hotel front desk or airbnb host to make a reservation for you.
