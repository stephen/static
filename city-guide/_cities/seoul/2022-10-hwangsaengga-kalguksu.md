title: "Hwangsaengga Kalguksu (황생가칼국수)"
kind: korean food

I thought the kalguksoo at Myeongdong Kyoja was better, but the mandu here was better. The kimchi here is also one of the best kimchis I’ve had in Korea so far. The store workers are friendly and welcoming. We waited about 45 mins during dinner time on a Sunday.
