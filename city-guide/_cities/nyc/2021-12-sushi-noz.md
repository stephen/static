I love the space and presentation - pretty much everything is prepared in front of you, including pieces of anago that are smoked behind the counter on a charcoal grill.

A couple highlights were the katsuo sashimi (with crispy skin!!) and nodoguro perched atop uni rice. Overall, it's good but not my taste - for instance, I don't like shirako, but I have to begrudgingly accept that it was well-made here.
