This place is fine, but did not scratch my itch for Taiwanese food.

Many items are disappointingly fusion-ified, like the 牛肉捲餅 (beef rolls) that substitute mayonnaise for hoison sauce. Kind of criminal.

Yolanda says, "I think the only thing worth getting is the 滷肉飯 (braised pork on rice)," even with its non-traditional taste.
