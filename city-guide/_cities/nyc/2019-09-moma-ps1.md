The PS1 is an offshoot of the MoMA in Long Island City. As with other contemporary art museums, enjoyment is pretty dependent on what's on exhibition, so it's worth checking the website first.

My favorite thing to do here is visit the James Turrell (*Meeting*) space on the top floor. Sadly, making it into the room is very hit or miss. On my most recent visit (Dec 2021), the room wasn't open to the public. There's a neat sunset viewing program to accompany the space, but it's usually booked out months in advanced.
