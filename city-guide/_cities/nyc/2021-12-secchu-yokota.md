Tiny place for tempura omakase. Tasty and relaxed setting. The courses are seasonal - in the winter, my favorites were the Japanese whiting, chrysanthemum leaf, and shrimp head. In a summer seating, I liked the conger eel and watermelon dessert.

The dessert was also a highlight. The chef's background is in French cuisine, so the dessert course was not only delicious, but also nicely plated.
