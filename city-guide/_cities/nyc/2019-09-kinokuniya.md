What can I say? It's a Kinokuniya.

This one is pretty big: one floor for English, one floor for Japanese, and one floor for weebs.

I came here a couple times to purchase Japanese novels for practice. Fun fact: books in Japanese seem to be organized by publisher. A single author might be in multiple sections depending on what company published the work.
