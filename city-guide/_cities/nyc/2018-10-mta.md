Kind of a disaster, but pretty good for an American city? The system works, until it doesn't. One time I was on a uptown-bound C train and next thing I know I'm crossing the Brooklyn bridge. Service does seem better in Manhattan than in other boroughs.

As for busses, SBS has dedicated bus lanes and actually works okay. I mean, it's still a bus but...
