My favorite place for Omakase so far. The flavors are out of this world - quite a pleasant surprise after I had gone through a string of mediocre sushi places in New York. 

The atmosphere is a bit stiff, but not super uncomfortable. I liked the sake pairing but it can be overwhelming in both alcohol volume and snooty explanations.
