Great, modern-ish Chinese food. Uluh is hulu (葫芦) backwards, but I guess you can't name your Chinese restaurant after a Chinese gourd when an American startup decides to use it. My favorites are the pork trotters and truffle fried rice. The duck is not bad, but a little pricey for how much duck you get.
