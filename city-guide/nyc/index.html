style="background-color:#1e90ff10"><h1>New York City</h1></aside></header><div class="Home_grid__GxQ85"><div class="Home_list__qBUOI"><h1 style="border-bottom-color:#1e90ff">lunch</h1><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Tempura Matsui</h3><div><p>We went for lunch which was a steal for $60. Everything is super well made and tasty.</p>
<p>I thought it would be too greasy (in a 油腻 kind of way) but it was surprisingly light for tempura. The chef says keeping the oil at the right temperature is key to keep the oiliness in balance.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Davelle</h3><div><p>Cute, small cafe with a Japanese menu. The curry with karaage is great and the toast (berry and cream cheese!) is very delicious and very instagramable.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Hi-collar</h3><div><p>Pretty good! The wait can be quite long, even after you get seated. The siphon coffee was neat and I like the coffee jelly and katsu sando.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Boxed To-Go (BT)</h3><div><p>&lt;$10 Bentos. Pretty solid. The portions are small, but it&#x27;s perfect for a light lunch. The fried shrimp is my favorite.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Panineria</h3><div><p>Good paninis. It&#x27;s meat and cheese. I like the Paestum (prosciutto and cheese) with some fig jam.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Panya</h3><div><p>I like the Japanese breakfast. Nice set meal to start the day. The cream pan is not bad too.</p></div></div></div><div class="Home_list__qBUOI"><h1 style="border-bottom-color:#1e90ff">dessert</h1><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Cha-an Teahouse</h3><div><p>Japanese sweets. The seasonally flavored parfaits are a treasure chest - different treat in each bite!</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Keki</h3><div><p>I have been craving castella ever since I had it in Taiwan. This place does pretty good castella. I like to eat the fresh cake same-day, then freeze the rest for a different, but equally tasty texture.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Levain Bakery</h3><div><p>The huge, monster, gooey cookies are so good. When I used to visit the city, I&#x27;d fly home with a bag of these to keep in my freezer for emergencies.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Sundaes and Cones</h3><div><p>I think I only like this place because it&#x27;s on my block. But it&#x27;s not bad. I like the taro and pistachio flavors in a waffle cone the best.</p></div></div></div><div class="Home_list__qBUOI"><h1 style="border-bottom-color:#1e90ff">sushi</h1><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Uchu</h3><div><p>My favorite place for Omakase so far. The flavors are out of this world - quite a pleasant surprise after I had gone through a string of mediocre sushi places in New York.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is a bit stiff, but not super uncomfortable. I liked the sake pairing but it can be overwhelming in both alcohol volume and snooty explanations.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Yoshino</h3><div><p>Really, really great Omakase. I&#x27;d say the flavors are more tame compared to Uchu, but still exceptionally good.</p>
<p>My favorites were the saba (saba nice day!), anago, kue, nodoguro and tamagoyaki.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Masa</h3><div><p>Kind of overhyped and full of bros when I went. The sushi was fine, but not my favorite. Probably most similar to Sushi Noz, out of other places I&#x27;ve tried in the city.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>69 Leonard Street (Shion)</h3><div><p>The one standout piece I remember was the Tamagoyaki at the end. Kind of incredible texture. My other favorites were the uni tasting and shima aji.</p>
<p>Yolanda notes, &quot;the best crab of my life.&quot;</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Noz Market</h3><div><p>An offshoot of Sushi Noz. I actually enjoyed Noz Market more (as it&#x27;s own thing) than Sushi Noz. The chirashi is really excellent and worth a try.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Sushi by M</h3><div><p>I think this place is very okay, but Yolanda notes, &quot;A great introduction to omakase. The value was good for the price, and the chefs are very friendly and social.&quot;</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Sushi Noz</h3><div><p>I love the space and presentation - pretty much everything is prepared in front of you, including pieces of anago that are smoked behind the counter on a charcoal grill.</p>
<p>A couple highlights were the katsuo sashimi (with crispy skin!!) and nodoguro perched atop uni rice. Overall, it&#x27;s good but not my taste - for instance, I don&#x27;t like shirako, but I have to begrudgingly accept that it was well-made here.</p></div></div></div><div class="Home_list__qBUOI"><h1 style="border-bottom-color:#1e90ff">dinner</h1><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>uluh</h3><div><p>Great, modern-ish Chinese food. Uluh is hulu (葫芦) backwards, but I guess you can&#x27;t name your Chinese restaurant after a Chinese gourd when a streaming service takes it first.</p>
<p>My favorites are the pork trotters and truffle fried rice. The duck is not bad, but a little pricey for how much duck you get.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>886</h3><div><p>This place is fine, but did not scratch my itch for Taiwanese food.</p>
<p>Many items are disappointingly fusion-ified, like the 牛肉捲餅 (beef rolls) that substitute mayonnaise for hoison sauce. Kind of criminal.</p>
<p>Yolanda says, &quot;I think the only thing worth getting is the 滷肉飯 (braised pork on rice),&quot; even with its non-traditional taste.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Aburiya Kinnosuke</h3><div><p>The grilled fish is so good. Other appetizers are not bad, but the saba shioyaki and hamachi kama are the best.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Benemon</h3><div><p>The star here is the appetizers. I like the gobo, tofu, tempura, both tatakis, and the (fried) soft shell crab is the best. The rice bowls and curry are fine but not anything special.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Dolar Shop</h3><div><p>The hotpot is good. The wait can be kind of insane, so get a reservation. I usually like spicy broths, but in this case the silver soup is the thing to get.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Haenyeo</h3><div><p>Yolanda notes, &quot;Amazing Korean food. We liked the chicken wings, scallion pancake, and sablefish the most. The cocktails were also tasty and interesting. Great place for a cute date.&quot;</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Ise</h3><div><p>Pretty solid Japanese food. I like the soba, but not as much as Sobaya.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Izakaya Mew</h3><div><p>It&#x27;s good! The corn tempura is a highlight. I also liked the hamachi kama, eggplant, and cheesecake. The menu seems seasonal, so YMMV.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Jua</h3><div><p>Yolanda notes, &quot;One of the best meals I&#x27;ve had in NYC. I loved everything here, and they even managed to make some of my least favorite ingredients (kimchi, tomatoes) really delicious.&quot;</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Mala Project</h3><div><p>Drypot drypot drypot.

The chef says keeping the oil at the right temperature is key to keep the oiliness in balance.\n","date":"2021-09"},{"title":"Cha-an Teahouse","rating":"favorite","kind":"dessert","description":"Japanese sweets.
