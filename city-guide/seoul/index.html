desserts I’ve had in my life. The cafe is also very aesthetic.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Baekmidang (백미당)</p></h3><div><p>A chain that sells soft serve. It&#x27;s pretty good, worth trying.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Cafe Haina (하인나커피)</p></h3><div><p>A hidden gem that we randomly stumbled across. Their mango shaved ice is amazing and very aesthetic.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Knotted (노티드)</p></h3><div><p>They had really tasty donuts. They run out quickly though, so go early.</p></div></div></div><div class="Home_list__qBUOI"><h1 style="border-bottom-color:#747d8c">korean food</h1><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Myeongdong Kyoja (명동교자)</p></h3><div><p>Kalguksu. One of our favorite meals in Seoul. Their dumplings are also very good. Stephen says their kalguksu just tastes like Chinese 排骨汤. Yum.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Yeongdong Freshwater Eel (영동 민물장어)</p></h3><div><p>The eel here is really delicious. We got the mud water eel (the most expensive thing they had), and it was worth it. They cook the eel for you in front of you.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Buchon Yukhoe (부촌육회)</p></h3><div><p>Good place to try yukhoe (raw Korean beef) and moving octopus legs. I really liked it, but it&#x27;s probably not for everyone.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>곽만근갈비탕이야기</p></h3><div><p>Really good galbitang. I was told this place is a chain, but I was not good enough at Korean to figure out where the other locations are.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Hwangsaengga Kalguksu (황생가칼국수)</p></h3><div><p>I thought the kalguksoo at Myeongdong Kyoja was better, but the mandu here was better. The kimchi here is also one of the best kimchis I’ve had in Korea so far. The store workers are friendly and welcoming. We waited about 45 mins during dinner time on a Sunday.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Kim &amp; Kim King Crab (김앤김대게)</p></h3><div><p>Worth going if you like crab. The crab was delicious, but some of the other dishes were not great. We also ordered way more than we needed. They recommended 3-4kg for 4 people, but I think 2 or 2.5kg would have been a good amount for us.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Lotteria (롯데리아)</p></h3><div><p>Bulgogi burgers. They taste kinda... interesting and are worth trying, imo. I liked it, and Stephen thought it was just okay.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Okdongsik (옥동식)</p></h3><div><p>Dwaeji gukbap (pork rice soup). The broth and meat were refreshing and really well-done.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Tosokchon Samgyetang (토속촌 삼계탕)</p></h3><div><p>This was the best samgyetang that I’ve had. The chicken was tender and perfectly cooked, and the soup was well seasoned and not too herbal.</p></div></div></div><div class="Home_list__qBUOI"><h1 style="border-bottom-color:#747d8c">japanese food</h1><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Sushi Kanae (스시카나에)</p></h3><div><p>All the pieces were delicious, especially the signature chu-toro.
