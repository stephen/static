Coffee</p></h3><div><p>Pretty good. I think this one is tied for first with Crispy Grindz. My favorite is the liliko&#x27;i moana bowl. The honey is what makes it work.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Crispy Grindz</p></h3><div><p>Despite the unconvincing name, the acai here is really good. The acai base is not blended with other junk. I like to get it with honey and extra granola.</p>
<p>The non-acai menu items are okay but not special.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Banzai Bowls</p></h3><div><p>The bowl is massive but sadly, not very good. Tasted more like an apple juice smoothie than anything else. Ratio of acai puree to other toppings is off.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Haleiwa Bowls</p></h3><div><p>It&#x27;s okay. The bowls are slightly on the bigger side. I tried both the mana and hapa bowls, but both kind of tasted like juice.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Sunrise Shack</p></h3><div><p>Not very good. The acai is blended and doesn&#x27;t taste like acai.</p></div></div></div><div class="Home_list__qBUOI"><h1 style="border-bottom-color:#1e90ff">snacks</h1><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Angel&#x27;s Ice Cream</p></h3><div><p>The shaved ice was fine. The real star is the Ube Milkshake. So creamy. So ube-y. Very good.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Matsumoto Shave Ice</p></h3><div><p>It&#x27;s simple but good.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Kona Coffee Purveyors</p></h3><div><p>The coffee is fine. The gem is that they serve pastries from b. patisserie. The kouign amann is quite good.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Musubi Cafe Iyasume</p></h3><div><p>Great spam musubi. I like the regular kind.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Paalaa Kai Bakery</p></h3><div><p>The signature pastry is the Snow Puffy. Worth a try.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Nisshodo</p></h3><div><p>Tasty mochi treats. We got one of everything and sampled for a few days.</p>
<p>The store keeps weird hours, so I&#x27;d recommend calling ahead. (We came here on 4 separate occasions and only successfully purchased mochi once.)</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Duke&#x27;s Food Hall</p></h3><div><p>It&#x27;s a big food hall with a few different shops. In particular, the mochi malasada is good (and sometimes runs out).</p></div></div></div><div class="Home_list__qBUOI"><h1 style="border-bottom-color:#1e90ff">activities</h1><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Climbworks</p></h3><div><p>I did not expect to enjoy this (ziplining) as much as I did. It&#x27;s pretty fun! A little terrifying to start.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Aweoweo Beach</p></h3><div><p>Kind of hidden, though we happened to live behind this beach. When the waves aren&#x27;t rough, it&#x27;s really good for snorkeling.</p>
<p>I consistently see a family of sea turtles here, so I&#x27;m not sure why anybody is <a href="https://www.hawaiimagazine.com/laniakea-beach-on-oahus-north-shore-may-soon-have-a-temporary-fix-for-traffic/">causing a traffic jam at Laniakea</a>.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Hanauma Bay</p></h3><div><p>A bit of a hassle to get into. You need timed-entry tickets a couple days beforehand.</p>
<p>Beach itself is nice but rather crowded. You can see a lot of fish here. A lot of families come here it seems.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Honolulu Museum of Art</p></h3><div><p>Kind of neat art museum. I liked the contemporary exhibitions and the courtyards are nice to stroll through.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Ka&#x27;ena Point</p></h3><div><p>Western-most point on Oahu. It&#x27;s a 2-3 mile hike that&#x27;s relatively flat and along the beach. We went on the first day after a rainy spell, so the ground was a bit muddy.</p>
<p>Sunset is really neat, but you end up walking back in the dark for an hour or so. I&#x27;d recommend a flash light.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Makapu&#x27;u Point Lighthouse Trail</p></h3><div><p>Fun for a sunrise hike. I&#x27;d say you want to get there ~30 minutes before sunrise for best results. The gate to the parking lot opens at 7am, but you can park outside the gate anyways.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3><p>Waiamea Valley</p></h3><div><p>It&#x27;s more of a botanical garden than anything else.
