class="Home_listDescription__zU71D">I didn&#x27;t think I liked acai bowls, but Yolanda took me to enough of them that I formed an opinion.</p><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Island Vintage Coffee</h3><div><p>Pretty good. I think this one is tied for first with Crispy Grindz. My favorite is the liliko&#x27;i moana bowl. The honey is what makes it work.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Crispy Grindz</h3><div><p>Despite the unconvincing name, the acai here is really good. The acai base is not blended with other junk. I like to get it with honey and extra granola.</p>
<p>The non-acai menu items are okay but not special.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Banzai Bowls</h3><div><p>The bowl is massive but sadly, not very good. Tasted more like an apple juice smoothie than anything else. Ratio of acai puree to other toppings is off.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Haleiwa Bowls</h3><div><p>It&#x27;s okay. The bowls are slightly on the bigger side. I tried both the mana and hapa bowls, but both kind of tasted like juice.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Sunrise Shack</h3><div><p>Not very good. The acai is blended and doesn&#x27;t taste like acai.</p></div></div></div><div class="Home_list__qBUOI"><h1 style="border-bottom-color:#1e90ff">snacks</h1><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Angel&#x27;s Ice Cream</h3><div><p>The shaved ice was fine. The real star is the Ube Milkshake. So creamy. So ube-y. Very good.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Matsumoto Shave Ice</h3><div><p>It&#x27;s simple but good.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Kona Coffee Purveyors</h3><div><p>The coffee is fine. The gem is that they serve pastries from b. patisserie. The kouign amann is quite good.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Musubi Cafe Iyasume</h3><div><p>Great spam musubi. I like the regular kind.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Paalaa Kai Bakery</h3><div><p>The signature pastry is the Snow Puffy. Worth a try.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Duke&#x27;s Food Hall</h3><div><p>It&#x27;s a big food hall with a few different shops. In particular, the mochi malasada is good (and sometimes runs out).</p></div></div></div><div class="Home_list__qBUOI"><h1 style="border-bottom-color:#1e90ff">activities</h1><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Climbworks</h3><div><p>I did not expect to enjoy this (ziplining) as much as I did. It&#x27;s pretty fun! A little terrifying to start.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Aweoweo Beach</h3><div><p>Kind of hidden, though we happened to live behind this beach. When the waves aren&#x27;t rough, it&#x27;s really good for snorkeling.</p>
<p>I consistently see a family of sea turtles here, so I&#x27;m not sure why anybody is <a href="https://www.hawaiimagazine.com/laniakea-beach-on-oahus-north-shore-may-soon-have-a-temporary-fix-for-traffic/">causing a traffic jam at Laniakea</a>.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Don Quixote</h3><div><p>Your one-stop shop for anything you could possible need on a trip. It&#x27;s like a Japanese Wal-mart.</p>
<p>The only bad thing I can say about this place is that they don&#x27;t play the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zl88Aieecw&amp;t=45s">theme song</a>.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Hanauma Bay</h3><div><p>A bit of a hassle to get into. You need timed-entry tickets a couple days beforehand.</p>
<p>Beach itself is nice but rather crowded. You can see a lot of fish here. A lot of families come here it seems.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Honolulu Museum of Art</h3><div><p>Kind of neat art museum. I liked the contemporary exhibitions and the courtyards are nice to stroll through.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Marukai Market</h3><div><p>Apparently it&#x27;s owned by Donki too. There&#x27;s an expansive ready-to-eat food section. Nothing in particular is outstanding, but it&#x27;s all not bad. Good variety.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Ka&#x27;ena Point</h3><div><p>Ka&#x27;ena point is the western most spot on Oahu. It&#x27;s a 2-3 mile hike that&#x27;s relatively flat and along the beach. We went on the first day after a rainy spell, so the ground was a bit muddy.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Waiamea Valley</h3><div><p>It&#x27;s more of a botanical garden than anything else. Nice to stroll through, but kind of pricey ($20/per) for what it is.</p></div></div></div><div class="Home_list__qBUOI"><h1 style="border-bottom-color:#1e90ff">dinner</h1><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Japanese Food Truck No. 7</h3><div><p>Pretty good for food truck food. Sometimes I crave udon so this place hits the spot.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Mitch&#x27;s Fish Market</h3><div><p>It&#x27;s not bad - the nigiri is fine. The hand rolls were quite good. Apparently Obama has been here.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Opal Thai</h3><div><p>Kind of cool. The head chef takes a survey on what the table likes and doesn&#x27;t like and makes food from there. He&#x27;s very opinionated.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Yamada Chikara</h3><div><p>Everything is delicious and the stream of food feels never ending. Come with an empty stomach.</p>
<p>Sadly, it looks like this spot closed for good recently.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Fooki</h3><div><p>The pork belly rice and the beef scallion noodles were really good. Other dishes were a miss.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Izakaya Pau Hana Base</h3><div><p>It&#x27;s not bad, but not super special. The mackerel was pretty good.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Zippy&#x27;s</h3><div><p>Apparently this is a Hawaiian staple. I thought it would be fast food but feels more like a diner.</p></div></div></div><div class="Home_list__qBUOI"><h1 style="border-bottom-color:#1e90ff">lunch</h1><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Poke for the People</h3><div><p>Pretty good poke, though not anything special.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>Tonkatsu Ginza Bairin</h3><div><p>Delicious, but you do need a reservation. We got the specialty pork katsu which was quite good.</p></div></div><div class="Home_place__oOy_q"><h3>McDonald&#x27;s</h3><div><p>Yes, it&#x27;s just McDonald&#x27;s.

I think this one is tied for first with Crispy Grindz. My favorite is the liliko'i moana bowl. The honey is what makes it work.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Crispy Grindz","rating":"favorite","kind":"acai","description":"Despite the unconvincing name, the acai here is really good. The acai base is not blended with other junk. I like to get it with honey and extra granola.\n\nThe non-acai menu items are okay but not special.\n","date":"2022-01"},{"title":"Angel's Ice Cream","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"The shaved ice was fine. The real star is the Ube Milkshake. So creamy. So ube-y. Very good.\n","date":"2012-12"},{"title":"Climbworks","rating":"recommended","kind":"activities","description":"I did not expect to enjoy this (ziplining) as much as I did. It's pretty fun! A little terrifying to start.\n","date":"2012-12"},{"title":"Japanese Food Truck No. 7","rating":"recommended","kind":"dinner","description":"Pretty good for food truck food. Sometimes I crave udon so this place hits the spot.\n","date":"2012-12"},{"title":"Matsumoto Shave Ice","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"It's simple but good.\n","date":"2012-12"},{"title":"Mitch's Fish Market","rating":"recommended","kind":"dinner","description":"It's not bad - the nigiri is fine. The hand rolls were quite good. Apparently Obama has been here.\n","date":"2012-12"},{"title":"Kona Coffee Purveyors","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"The coffee is fine. The gem is that they serve pastries from b. patisserie. The kouign amann is quite good.\n","date":"2021-07"},{"title":"Musubi Cafe Iyasume","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"Great spam musubi. I like the regular kind.\n","date":"2021-07"},{"title":"Opal Thai","rating":"recommended","kind":"dinner","description":"Kind of cool. The head chef takes a survey on what the table likes and doesn't like and makes food from there. He's very opinionated.\n","date":"2021-07"},{"title":"Paalaa Kai Bakery","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"The signature pastry is the Snow Puffy. Worth a try.\n","date":"2021-07"},{"title":"Poke for the People","rating":"recommended","kind":"lunch","description":"Pretty good poke, though not anything special.\n","date":"2021-07"},{"title":"Rental Car","rating":"recommended","kind":"transit","description":"Transit more or less doesn't exist.

Atmosphere was pretty relaxed and I remember enjoying talking with the chef.\n","date":"2021-07"},{"title":"Tonkatsu Ginza Bairin","rating":"recommended","kind":"lunch","description":"Delicious, but you do need a reservation. We got the specialty pork katsu which was quite good.\n","date":"2021-07"},{"title":"Yamada Chikara","rating":"recommended","kind":"dinner","description":"Everything is delicious and the stream of food feels never ending. Come with an empty stomach.\n\nSadly, it looks like this spot closed for good recently.\n","date":"2021-07"},{"title":"Aweoweo Beach","rating":"recommended","kind":"activities","description":"Kind of hidden, though we happened to live behind this beach. When the waves aren't rough, it's really good for snorkeling.\n\nI consistently see a family of sea turtles here, so I'm not sure why anybody is [causing a traffic jam at Laniakea](https://www.hawaiimagazine.com/laniakea-beach-on-oahus-north-shore-may-soon-have-a-temporary-fix-for-traffic/).\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Banzai Bowls","rating":"recommended","kind":"acai","description":"The bowl is massive but sadly, not very good. Tasted more like an apple juice smoothie than anything else. Ratio of acai puree to other toppings is off.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Don Quixote","rating":"recommended","kind":"activities","description":"Your one-stop shop for anything you could possible need on a trip. It's like a Japanese Wal-mart.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say about this place is that they don't play the [theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zl88Aieecw\u0026t=45s).\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Fooki","rating":"recommended","kind":"dinner","description":"The pork belly rice and the beef scallion noodles were really good. Other dishes were a miss.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Haleiwa Bowls","rating":"recommended","kind":"acai","description":"It's okay. The bowls are slightly on the bigger side. I tried both the mana and hapa bowls, but both kind of tasted like juice.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Hanauma Bay","rating":"recommended","kind":"activities","description":"A bit of a hassle to get into. You need timed-entry tickets a couple days beforehand.\n\nBeach itself is nice but rather crowded. You can see a lot of fish here. A lot of families come here it seems.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Honolulu Museum of Art","rating":"recommended","kind":"activities","description":"Kind of neat art museum. I liked the contemporary exhibitions and the courtyards are nice to stroll through.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Izakaya Pau Hana Base","rating":"recommended","kind":"dinner","description":"It's not bad, but not super special. The mackerel was pretty good.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Marukai Market","rating":"recommended","kind":"activities","description":"Apparently it's owned by Donki too. There's an expansive ready-to-eat food section. Nothing in particular is outstanding, but it's all not bad. Good variety.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"McDonald's","rating":"recommended","kind":"lunch","description":"Yes, it's just McDonald's. But they have some Hawaiian specialty items!

Not amazing but worth a try.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Sunrise Shack","rating":"recommended","kind":"acai","description":"Not very good. The acai is blended and doesn't taste like acai.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Sushi Sho","rating":"recommended","kind":"sushi","description":"Unfortunately, I haven't eaten at the restaurant yet - it seems hard to get into. They sell takeout bento boxes though, that are quite good.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Zippy's","rating":"recommended","kind":"dinner","description":"Apparently this is a Hawaiian staple. I thought it would be fast food but feels more like a diner.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Ka'ena Point","rating":"recommended","kind":"activities","description":"Ka'ena point is the western most spot on Oahu. It's a 2-3 mile hike that's relatively flat and along the beach. We went on the first day after a rainy spell, so the ground was a bit muddy.\n","date":"2022-01"},{"title":"Waiamea Valley","rating":"recommended","kind":"activities","description":"It's more of a botanical garden than anything else. Nice to stroll through, but kind of pricey ($20/per) for what it is.\n","date":"2022-01"},{"title":"Duke's Food Hall","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"It's a big food hall with a few different shops.
