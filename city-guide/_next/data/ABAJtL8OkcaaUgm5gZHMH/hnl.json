{"pageProps":{"places":[{"title":"Island Vintage Coffee","rating":"favorite","kind":"acai","description":"Pretty good. I think this one is tied for first with Crispy Grindz. My favorite is the liliko'i moana bowl. The honey is what makes it work.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Crispy Grindz","rating":"favorite","kind":"acai","description":"Despite the unconvincing name, the acai here is really good. The acai base is not blended with other junk. I like to get it with honey and extra granola.\n\nThe non-acai menu items are okay but not special.\n","date":"2022-01"},{"title":"Angel's Ice Cream","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"The shaved ice was fine. The real star is the Ube Milkshake. So creamy. So ube-y. Very good.\n","date":"2012-12"},{"title":"Climbworks","rating":"recommended","kind":"activities","description":"I did not expect to enjoy this (ziplining) as much as I did. It's pretty fun! A little terrifying to start.\n","date":"2012-12"},{"title":"Japanese Food Truck No. 7","rating":"recommended","kind":"dinner","description":"Pretty good for food truck food. Sometimes I crave udon so this place hits the spot.\n","date":"2012-12"},{"title":"Matsumoto Shave Ice","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"It's simple but good.\n","date":"2012-12"},{"title":"Mitch's Fish Market","rating":"recommended","kind":"dinner","description":"It's not bad - the nigiri is fine. The hand rolls were quite good. Apparently Obama has been here.\n","date":"2012-12"},{"title":"Kona Coffee Purveyors","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"The coffee is fine. The gem is that they serve pastries from b. patisserie. The kouign amann is quite good.\n","date":"2021-07"},{"title":"Opal Thai","rating":"recommended","kind":"dinner","description":"Kind of cool. The head chef takes a survey on what the table likes and doesn't like and makes food from there. He's very opinionated.\n","date":"2021-07"},{"title":"Rental Car","rating":"recommended","kind":"transit","description":"Transit more or less doesn't exist. There's _The Bus_, but service is infrequent and inconvenient.\n\nUnless you're exclusively doing things in Waikiki, getting a car seems to be an unfortunate necessity.\n","date":"2021-07"},{"title":"Sushi Sho","rating":"recommended","kind":"sushi","description":"I recall this being good, though I'm writing this 6 months after the fact. Atmosphere was pretty relaxed and I remember enjoying talking with the chef.\n","date":"2021-07"},{"title":"Aweoweo Beach","rating":"recommended","kind":"activities","description":"Kind of hidden, though we happened to live behind this beach. When the waves aren't rough, it's really good for snorkeling.\n\nI consistently see a family of sea turtles here, so I'm not sure why anybody is [causing a traffic jam at Laniakea](https://www.hawaiimagazine.com/laniakea-beach-on-oahus-north-shore-may-soon-have-a-temporary-fix-for-traffic/).\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Banzai Bowls","rating":"recommended","kind":"acai","description":"The bowl is massive but sadly, not very good. Tasted more like an apple juice smoothie than anything else. Ratio of acai puree to other toppings is off.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Don Quixote","rating":"recommended","kind":"activities","description":"Your one-stop shop for anything you could possible need on a trip. It's like a Japanese Wal-mart.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say about this place is that they don't play the [theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zl88Aieecw&t=45s).\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Fooki","rating":"recommended","kind":"lunch","description":"The pork belly rice and the beef scallion noodles were really good. Other dishes were a miss.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Haleiwa Bowls","rating":"recommended","kind":"acai","description":"It's okay. The bowls are slightly on the bigger side. I tried both the mana and hapa bowls, but both kind of tasted like juice.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Hanauma Bay","rating":"recommended","kind":"activities","description":"A bit of a hassle to get into. You need timed-entry tickets a couple days beforehand.\n\nBeach itself is nice but rather crowded. You can see a lot of fish here. A lot of families come here it seems.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Izakaya Pau Hana Base","rating":"recommended","kind":"dinner","description":"It's not bad, but not super special. The mackerel was pretty good.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Sunrise Shack","rating":"recommended","kind":"acai","description":"Not very good. The acai is blended and doesn't taste like acai.\n","date":"2021-12"},{"title":"Sushi Sho","rating":"recommended","kind":"sushi","description":"Unfortunately, I haven't eaten at the restaurant yet - it seems hard to get into. They sell takeout bento boxes though, that are quite good.\n","date":"2021-12"}],"city":{"abbr":"hnl","name":"Oahu","imgPosition":"left top","color":"#1e90ff"}},"__N_SSG":true}
