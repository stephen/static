{"pageProps":{"places":[{"title":"Seattle Public Library","rating":"recommended","kind":"activities","description":"The architecture is pretty neat. Unfortunately, during my most recent visit (Jan 2022), most floors were closed so you can't see much of it.\n","date":"2014-02"},{"title":"Din Tai Fung","rating":"recommended","kind":"dinner","description":"Yolanda notes, \"Americanized atmosphere, but the food tastes authentic and delicious.\"\n","date":"2022-01"},{"title":"Hannyatou","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"Cozy bar. We stopped by here while waiting for a table at Kamonegi next door. I like that they have a fridge for retail so you can get sake to go.\n","date":"2022-01"},{"title":"Kamonegi","rating":"recommended","kind":"dinner","description":"Specializes in tempura and soba. The tempura and starting sides are delicious. I liked the tsukemono and the ankimo. I had high hopes for the soba, but I think the noodles aren't quite the right consistency - too chewy and thick.\n","date":"2022-01"},{"title":"Nana's Green Tea","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"Probably the highlight of the trip. Really tasty snacks and light lunch. The katsu sando is better than the one at [Hi Collar](../nyc/). The sundae is on par with the one from [Cha-an](../nyc/). Really great. Worth a visit.\n","date":"2022-01"},{"title":"REI Flagship","rating":"recommended","kind":"shopping","description":"Biggest REI I've been to. There's a climbing wall, mini-bike trail, and waterfall on site.\n","date":"2022-01"},{"title":"Storyville Coffee","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"Really cute spot. The one in Pike Place overlooks the water. Coffee is not terrible, but not amazing, especially for the high prices.\n\nThe cinnamon roll is worth a try but gave me a stomachache afterwards.\n","date":"2022-01"}],"city":{"abbr":"sea","name":"Seattle","imgPosition":"none","color":"#747d8c"}},"__N_SSG":true}
