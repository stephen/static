{"pageProps":{"places":[{"title":"Kam Do Bakery","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"Tasty bakery. I like the pastries in the case like the taro puff, wife cake, and red bean cake.\n\nAmericans, beware that they only take Canadian debit cards. There's an ATM in the nearby mall.\n","date":"2019-03"},{"title":"Cartems Donuterie","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"Simple, decent donut. Kind of pricey.\n","date":"2022-01"},{"title":"Jenjudan (True Dan)","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"True Dan in Taiwan is my favorite place for boba. It's not quite the same here, but it's close enough. Better than the one I had in New York.\n\nMy favorite is the black sugar fresh milk (30% sweet, 70% ice).\n","date":"2022-01"},{"title":"Manpuku Bento","rating":"recommended","kind":"lunch","description":"I was unconvinced by the hole-in-the-wall location, but the food is really good and super cheap. There's no indoor dining and no seating nearby which can be a pain.\n","date":"2022-01"},{"title":"Nemesis Coffee","rating":"recommended","kind":"snacks","description":"Cute spot with a decent pour-over. I had a pistachio twist (pastry), but it was just okay.\n","date":"2022-01"},{"title":"R&H Chinese Food","rating":"recommended","kind":"lunch","description":"It's in the Lansdowne food court and quite solid. I liked the pan-fried pork buns. Sadly, they ran out of XLB before I could try but I bet they're good.\n","date":"2022-01"}],"city":{"abbr":"yvr","name":"Vancouver","imgPosition":"center","color":"#a4b0be"}},"__N_SSG":true}
