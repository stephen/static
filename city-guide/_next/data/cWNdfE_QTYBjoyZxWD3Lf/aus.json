Terry Black's is dependably good and has a fast moving line. The brisket and the beef ribs are delicious.\n","date":"2022-06"},{"title":"Uchi","rating":"recommended","kind":"sushi","description":"When I was in college, this was the first upscale sushi place I'd ever gone to and I thought it was soooo good. Revisiting several years later, it's too fusion for my taste.\n","date":"2022-06"},{"title":"County Line","rating":"okay","kind":"bbq","description":"This place has a nice, laid-back atmosphere but, I bbq is pretty meh. The bbq sauce is vinegary and weak.\n","date":"2022-06"},{"title":"Kemuri Tatsuya","rating":"okay","kind":"dinner","description":"Fusion izakaya. Some stuff is good, but the menu is too fusion for my taste. The tuna collar is delicious despite what they did to it.\n\nI'm not sure what I expected, but the $14 grapefruit sour is literally a glass of sochu and a grapefruit that you have to squeeze yourself (???).\n","date":"2022-11"},{"title":"la Barbecue","rating":"bad","kind":"bbq","description":"Admittedly, the bbq is delicious. However, the wait is long for no reason. It was worth trying, but I'm never standing in that line again.\n","date":"2022-06"}],"city":{"abbr":"aus","name":"Austin","imgPosition":"none","color":"##ffa502"}},"__N_SSG":true}
